ER Diagram Comments:

Our ER diagram shows a school management system with 5 main entities that represent the core components of academic administration. The Student and Course entities have a many-to-many relationship through the Enrollments relationship, which makes sense because students can take multiple courses and courses can have multiple students enrolled. We included a "Teaches" relationship between Instructor and Course as a one-to-many since each course has one instructor, but instructors can teach multiple courses. The Classroom entity connects to Course through an "IsIn" relationship because each course is held in a specific classroom, though classrooms can host different courses at different times. We made sure to include important attributes like email for both students and instructors (which need to be unique), and practical things like classroom capacity and course credits. The grade attribute is part of the Enrollments relationship rather than being a separate entity, which keeps things simpler while still tracking student performance.

Schema Mappings Comments:

Converting our ER diagram to relational tables was pretty straightforward for the most part. The Student, Instructor, Course, and Classroom entities became their own tables with their attributes as columns. The tricky part was handling the many-to-many relationship between Student and Course - we created an Enrollments table that uses student_id and course_id as foreign keys, plus semester to make a composite primary key since students can retake courses in different semesters. We added proper constraints like NOT NULL for essential fields, UNIQUE for emails and course codes, and CHECK constraints to make sure credits and capacity are always positive numbers. The foreign key relationships maintain referential integrity - you can't enroll a student in a course that doesn't exist or assign a course to a non-existent classroom. One thing we learned is that the grade field in Enrollments can be NULL because students might be currently enrolled in a course that hasn't been graded yet, which is more realistic than forcing a grade value immediately.
